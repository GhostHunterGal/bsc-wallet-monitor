BSC Wallet Balance Monitor

Description: A simple React web application that monitors the balances of specified wallet addresses on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet. Users can initiate balance monitoring with a click of a button, and the app will display the current balances of the listed wallet addresses in Ether. The application uses Ethers.js to interact with the BSC Testnet, and a lightweight Express.js server to handle API requests.

It makes use of ethers 6.3 and allows users to have a server running locally on port 3001.

Make sure that your .env file has the current URL for the BSC testnet.
